# DIY PiKVM V1 Instructions

!!! tip "So many choices!"
    There are many different options with sub-items, so you can choose what will suit you.<br>
    However, we marked the recommended way by sign **`✮ ✮ ✮`**

## Required parts

1. **Raspberry Pi board**
    * **✮ ✮ ✮ [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)**.<br>
    * ... or [Raspberry Pi 2](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/).<br>
      *Does not support H.264 even with HDMI-CSI bridge.*

2. **MicroSD card minimum 8Gb class 10**

3. **Video capture device**
    * **✮ ✮ ✮ [HDMI-CSI bridge based on TC358743 chip](https://www.amazon.de/Waveshare-Raspberry-Supports-Backward-Compatible/dp/B092HVP926/)**.<br>
      *Supports H.264 video encoding on Raspberry Pi 3, automatic resolution selection and the lowest possible latency.*
    * ... or [HDMI-USB dongle](https://www.amazon.com/Capture-Streaming-Broadcasting-Conference-Teaching/dp/B09FLN63B3).<br>
      *Only heavy MJPEG video, no resolution detection, big latency compared to HDMI-CSI.
      Some users report hardware problems: the dongle may not work in the BIOS or simply stop working after a while.
      It's a black box, and no one knows what's inside it. If you have problems with it, it will not be possible to fix them.*

4. **[Official USB-Micro Power Supply](https://www.amazon.com/Capture-Streaming-Broadcasting-Conference-Teaching/dp/B09FLN63B3)**.

5. **The Pico HID Keyboard & mouse emulator**

6. **Optional features**

    ??? success "✮ ✮ ✮ ATX controller to manage the target host's power"

        {!_diy_parts_atx.md!}

    ??? note "PS/2 Keyboard & mouse"

        The use of PS/2 is intended for advanced users. Check out the additional list of details in advance
        in the [corresponding paragraph](pico_hid.md#ps2-keyboard-mouse) of the Pico HID manual.

    ??? note "VGA video capture"

        If you want to capture VGA from your server instead of HDMI,
        buy the [VGA-to-HDMI converter](https://aliexpress.com/item/3256801728005613.html).
        Some converters have issues with not supporting all resolutions and refresh rates.
